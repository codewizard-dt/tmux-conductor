# Wiki Index — Home Map

The page catalog and home Map of Content for this wiki. **Read this first on every query**, then drill into the linked pages. Updated on every ingest and every filed answer.

Conventions that govern every page (atomic pages, stable IDs, typed links, frontmatter namespace): see [conventions](conventions.md). Operation history: see [log](log.md).

Entry format: `- [Title](path) — one-line summary`.

The wiki is split into two domains with opposite organizing laws:
- **Knowledge** — timeless, link-navigated synthesis (sources, concepts, entities). Pages are listed individually below.
- **Work** — stateful, status-navigated lifecycle artifacts (requirements, decisions, roadmaps, tasks, uat, bugs). Items are **not** listed here — each family keeps its own `index.md` of active items; this page links to those.

## Knowledge

### Sources
_(none yet)_ — one summary page per ingested `raw/` source. See [knowledge/sources/](knowledge/sources/).

### Concepts
_(none yet)_ — patterns, ideas, conventions, recurring themes. See [knowledge/concepts/](knowledge/concepts/).

### Entities
_(none yet)_ — one page per entity, filed by sub-type:
- People — [knowledge/entities/people/](knowledge/entities/people/)
- Organisations — [knowledge/entities/organisations/](knowledge/entities/organisations/)
- Tools — [knowledge/entities/tools/](knowledge/entities/tools/)
- Components — [knowledge/entities/components/](knowledge/entities/components/) (this project's own modules, services, scripts)

## Work

Each family's `index.md` lists its **active items only** (completed/terminal items drop off the list; files never move — status lives in frontmatter).

- **Requirements** — REQ-NNN. [Active index](work/requirements/index.md) · [lifecycle](work/requirements/lifecycle.md)
- **Decisions** — DEC-NNNN (per-decision `#DM`). [Active index](work/decisions/index.md) · [lifecycle](work/decisions/lifecycle.md)
- **Roadmaps** — ROADMAP-NNN. [Active index](work/roadmaps/index.md) · [lifecycle](work/roadmaps/lifecycle.md)
- **Tasks** — TASK-NNN. [Active index](work/tasks/index.md) · [lifecycle](work/tasks/lifecycle.md)
- **UAT** — UAT-NNN, one per task. [Active index](work/uat/index.md) · [lifecycle](work/uat/lifecycle.md)
- **Bugs** — BUG-NNNN. [Active index](work/bugs/index.md) · [lifecycle](work/bugs/lifecycle.md)
